#LJUSSABEL
_We are currently in the process of adding material from all our contributing members, expect most material to be avaliable within a few days._
##Introduction
LJUSSABEL is a low-cost, make-it-yourself lightsaber. Made with an aluminium shaft, tough polycarbonate blade and run on an arduino pro mini.

##Background
LJUSSABEL is the result of a question posed to one of SkeMakes founding members. A local martial arts club was invited to arrange a Star-Wars themed live roleplay event for kids at the annual game/movie/comic convention Nordsken. They had sourced some clear polycarbonate tubes from a company making snow season road markers and wanted to know if it was possible to find a cheap way to light them up to emulate lightsabers. After some intensive googling, our reply was: "Yes, and we can add sound to them too!". 

##What
The sabers feature light, sound and motion/clash sensitivity. They are tough enough to fight with (tested by the local Kendoka) and suitable for both kids and adults.

##Who
LJUSSABEL is developed by community and in collaboration with other non-profit organisations. The circuitry and design is made by one of our members and the soldering, programming and general problem solving has been done by the members on a volunteer basis.

It's a co-creative, open source, collaborative projekt made by creative makers and devoted people working together.
